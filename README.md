### Section 01 - Getting Started

#### What is Clean Code?

- Clean code is easy to understand
  - Be readable and meaningful
  - Reduce cognitive load
  - Be concise and "to the point"
  - Avoid unintuitive names, complex nesting and big code blocks
  - Follow common best practices and patterns
  - Be fun to write and to maintain

#### Key pain points

- The names: variables, functions, classes
- Structure and Comments: Code formatting, good and bad comments
- Functions: length, parameters
- Conditionals and Error Handling: Deep nesting, missing error handling
- Classes and Data Structures: missing distinction, Bloated classes
